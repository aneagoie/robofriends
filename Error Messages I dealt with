Error Messages I dealt with
9/28/21 Robofriends: Npm start' fails on react-scripts-start initial attempt. I did npm install, didn't work, npm update and I ended up with things that needed manual fix. react-script was included and up to date in my package.json. When I did npm build on my orig robofriends, it deleted all of the files I created and just did build on the generic files we started out with, so I forked andrei's version over to my github and created a repo and pushed to my computer.

had to run this command:
npx browserslist@latest --update-db

Then ran npm audit again b/c there were 3 issues I needed to fix. Above still didn't fix the browserslist issue, so added this in package.json. browserslist was already in there, but I then updated the 1st 3 lines in bracket:
"browserslist": [
    "last 1 version",
    "> 1%",
    "maintained node versions",
    "not dead"
  ]
Then I did npm update and all hell broke lose
Failed to parse package.json data.
error JSON.parse package.json must be actual JSON, not just JavaScript. I did npm cache clean and then npm cache clean --force. Neither of those worked at all. The reason is that I was missing a comma after "last 1 version". Put that in and now back to 'react-scripts' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.
